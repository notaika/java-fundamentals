    /*zzz
    * When to use abstract classes vs. interfaces
    * ABSTRACT
    *   - when you want to share code (fields/methods) across related classes
    *   - need constructors or non-static fields
    *   - modelling an "is-a" relationship
    * INTERFACE
    *   - want to define a capability
    *   - need multiple inheritance since a class can only have one superclass, but can implement multiple interfaces
    *   - modelling a "can-do" behaviour across unrelated classes
    * In other ways of thinking... (revisit this later)
    *   Abstract class = shared blueprint w/ partial implementation that's a MUST-have
    *   Interface = like a contract for behaviour with no shared state (?)
    *
    * revisit topic later.... @_@
