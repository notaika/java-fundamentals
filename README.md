# Java Fundamentals

This repo was made to keep track of my Java progress from scratch and to help motivate me to keep coding/practicing every day.

It contains code examples of foundational concepts along with some small console projects to challenge myself after learning the theory. Commits are organized by concept and practice sessions.

## Progress Log

### June 11, 2025
- Started Java basics
- Practiced syntax, `main()` method, and basic printing
- Learned about `int`, `double`, `boolean`, `char`, and `String` types

### June 12, 2025
- Worked with methods and parameters
- Practiced creating constructors and objects
- Built a simple `BankAccount` console project
- Learned about encapsulation with getters and setters

### June 13, 2025
- Practiced arrays and loops
- Built primitive data-type helper functions to practice Wrapper Class built-in methods (static/instance)
- Learned about Java Records

### June 14–15, 2025
- Dove deeper in understanding access modifiers and non-access modifiers
- Learned inheritance and class hierarchies
- Studied constructor chaining with `super()`
- Practiced overriding methods and polymorphism
- Started abstract classes and visibility rules

### June 16, 2025
- Deep dive into interfaces vs abstract classes
- Wrote comparison tables and examples
- Learned about default and static methods in interfaces
- Explored use cases where you'd use one over the other <br>

_**NOTE TO SELF:** Not urgent right now, but in the future — dive deeper and review abstract classes vs. interfaces. Not fully comfortable on knowing best use cases for both. (2025-06-17)_

### June 17, 2025
- Started Java Collections
- Studied `List`, `Set`, `Queue`, `Map` interfaces
- Practiced with `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `HashSet`, `LinkedHashSet`, `TreeSet`, `ArrayDeque`, and `HashMap`
- Explored generics (`<T>`, `<K, V>`) and iteration patterns
- Compared `.remove()`, `.poll()`, `.offer()`, and `.add()` for queues

_**NOTE TO SELF:** Still need a lot of practice and clarification about these data structures. Will supplement some documentation and books. (2025-06-17)_

### June 18, 2025
- Learned about Java Iterators and For-Each:
    - Practiced enhanced `for-each` loops 
    - Used `forEach()` method with lambda expressions and method references
    - Learned method reference syntax: `Class::method`, `object::method`, and constructor refs like `Class::new`
    - Use of `.entrySet()` for looping through `Map` key-value pairs
- Completed small Todo List console project to reinforce:
    - `ArrayList` usage and mutation
    - Loops, conditionals, and index validation
    - Creating and managing custom objects (`Task`)
    - Method decomposition and clean separation of logic (`run()`, `handleMenu()`)
    - Input handling using `Scanner` (`nextInt()` vs `nextLine()`)
- Implemented features: add task, view tasks, mark as done, delete completed, exit

## What's Next
**Last Updated:** 2025-05-18

This past week, I haven't really practiced writing my own code logic and exploring the concepts on my IDE by myself without help or instruction. I've gotten sucked into understanding OOP principles before diving into Data Structures, and that took a bit of time. After this concept on "Collection Iterators" — I plan on spending the rest of the week just writing down code and reinforcing my learning before I fly out to Toronto this weekend.
