# Java Fundamentals

This repo was made to keep track of my Java progress from scratch and to help motivate me to keep coding/practicing every day.

It contains code examples of foundational concepts along with some small console projects to challenge myself after learning the theory. Commits are organized by concept and practice sessions.

## Progress Log

### June 11, 2025
- Started Java basics
- Practiced syntax, `main()` method, and basic printing
- Learned about `int`, `double`, `boolean`, `char`, and `String` types

### June 12, 2025
- Worked with methods and parameters
- Practiced creating constructors and objects
- Built a simple `BankAccount` console project
- Learned about encapsulation with getters and setters

### June 13, 2025
- Practiced arrays and loops
- Built primitive data-type helper functions to practice Wrapper Class built-in methods (static/instance)
- Learned about Java Records

### June 14–15, 2025
- Dove deeper in understanding access modifiers and non-access modifiers
- Learned inheritance and class hierarchies
- Studied constructor chaining with `super()`
- Practiced overriding methods and polymorphism
- Started abstract classes and visibility rules

### June 16, 2025
- Deep dive into interfaces vs abstract classes
- Wrote comparison tables and examples
- Learned about default and static methods in interfaces
- Explored use cases where you'd use one over the other <br>

_**NOTE TO SELF:** Not urgent right now, but in the future — dive deeper and review abstract classes vs. interfaces. Not fully comfortable on knowing best use cases for both. (2025-06-17)_

### June 17, 2025
- Started Java Collections
- Studied `List`, `Set`, `Queue`, `Map` interfaces
- Practiced with `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `HashSet`, `LinkedHashSet`, `TreeSet`, `ArrayDeque`, and `HashMap`
- Explored generics (`<T>`, `<K, V>`) and iteration patterns
- Compared `.remove()`, `.poll()`, `.offer()`, and `.add()` for queues

_**NOTE TO SELF:** Still need a lot of practice and clarification about these data structures. Will supplement some documentation and books. (2025-06-17)_

### June 18, 2025
- Learned about Java Iterators and For-Each:
    - Practiced enhanced `for-each` loops 
    - Used `forEach()` method with lambda expressions and method references
    - Learned method reference syntax: `Class::method`, `object::method`, and constructor refs like `Class::new`
    - Use of `.entrySet()` for looping through `Map` key-value pairs
- Completed small Todo List console project to reinforce:
    - `ArrayList` usage and mutation
    - Loops, conditionals, and index validation
    - Creating and managing custom objects (`Task`)
    - Method decomposition and clean separation of logic (`run()`, `handleMenu()`)
    - Input handling using `Scanner` (`nextInt()` vs `nextLine()`)
- Implemented features: add task, view tasks, mark as done, delete completed, exit

### June 20, 2025
- Currently on the plane headed east watching Valorant Masters this weekend, so no studying but practiced coding concepts by creating a "Library Project". It's not yet done, needs polishing and quite a bit of refactoring. Coded for the entire flight (~4.5 hours)
  - Practiced and reinforced basic OOP concepts with:
    - Classes and Methods
    - Simple and basic data structures (List, ArrayList, Map, Hashmap)
    - Loops and switch statements

### June 23, 2025
- At the airport headed back west waiting to board my flight. No coding was done during the weekend but continued working on the mini Library Project.
  - Refactored and added a bit more code, will finish the rest when I land home.

## What's Next
**Last Updated:** 2025-05-23

Finish and polish the little mini Library Console project I started on the plane. Refresh concepts from last week, especially Collections and Data Structures. Later this week, start on map, streams, etc.
